### Deliverable 3
#### Objective
The third deliverable will focus on the initial improvement stage of the paperâ€™s reproduction, and as with every deliverable, we will lean on the [ACRe Guidelines](https://bitss.github.io/ACRE/improvements.html). In this deliverable we will focus on understanding and improving the code.


For this third deliverable I will be editing or commenting the existing code. To access the commit click on the comit's name. All commits are summarized in the following lists:

* **\_itt_oneendline.do**: This Do file creates the program that produces Table 3 of the paper. The proposed changes or comments to the files are the following:
